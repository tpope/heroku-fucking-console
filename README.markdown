# Heroku f-ing console

    $ heroku console
     !    `heroku console` has been disabled. Please use `heroku run` to run a console:
     !    https://devcenter.heroku.com/changelog-items/109."

F OFF.  You know what I f-ing mean.  Just f-ing do it.

After years of annoyance, I'm finally f-ing fixing this once and for all.

## Installation

    $ heroku plugins:install https://github.com/tpope/heroku-f-ing-console.git

## Usage

    $ heroku help f-ing
    Additional commands, type "heroku help COMMAND" for more details:

      f-ing:console  #  open a f-ing console
      f-ing:rake     #  execute a f-ing rake task

These commands are aliased to be namespace-free.  That's the whole f-ing
point.
